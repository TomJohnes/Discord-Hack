# Discord-Hack
This is  a script for an Discord Bot which can give you any roll on every server. I would watch this Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_sD9udZnCk&amp;t            The Bot need to be at the top of the roll list and you need to change the roll id ! You find the Roll number when you type \@(roll)                  Only paste the numbers!!!!  
You need to delete Your Main.js and set in the new one.
Then You need to make a folder called "Commands" and drag Twitch.js,   Partner.js,     notbremse.js !!!!!!
You need to fill in the roll id in the spaces at notbremse
If you done everything you should be able to write !notbremse to get the Roll!
NOTE: You need to write down the command for the highest roll under the bot roll.
Means:

               MEE6
               Owner 
               KrasseBananesBot
               Admin

In this situation you need to write down \@admin
If you done everything right it should give you the roll immidiently!
